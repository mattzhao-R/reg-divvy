# Oeconomica Divvy Bike Project 2021-2022
## Overview
This repo contains code and documents used for the 2021-2022 Labor and Consumption Cohort's research project. This project examined the impact of creating a divvy bike 
station in front of the Regenstein Library on the library's daily visitor count. We utilized public access divvy data from the city of Chicago as well as data from the 
University of Chicago on historical enrollment and Regenstein Library visitor counts. This README will describe the files, data, and code contained in this repo. Please 
direct any questions/comments/suggestions about the code, project, Oeconomica, etc. to [Matthew Zhao](mzhao117@uchicago.edu).

### Files
**Library-Data.csv**<br>
This file contains a novel dataset which we obtained from the University of Chicago through the Center for Digital Scholarship, holding daily library visitor counts. It 
has four variables: Date.of.Entry, Regenstein, Crear, and Total. Date.of.Entry specifies the date which the visitor entered and is documented at daily frequency 
(with some minor gaps). Regenstein and Crear contain the corresponding date's visitor count, while total is the sum of the two. There are very few missing data in this 
file, with most coming from the Crear visitor counts. Our project only utilized Date.of.Entry and Regenstein.
